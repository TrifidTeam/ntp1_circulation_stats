Message from the Trifid Team
----------------------------    
This is a quick script to parse the `get_token_holders` Neblio API endpoint and return the total circulating supply and number of unique addresses holding Trifid (TRIF).

This was written in python and you will need a few packages: `ast` which you can install via pip and and `swagger_client` as posted from the Neblio team. The `swagger_client` included is configured to communicate with Mainnet.
